## Excerpt from the Tutorial Page

<p>
  To get started, click either the "Get started!" link on the home page
  (below) or the "Start" link in the navigation menu.

  This should take you to the start page input form (below). Enter all
  the assets of interest into the corrsponding input fields. You can
  start typing a ticker or company name and if it is in the preloaded
  dataset it should appear in the dropdown datalist and be clickable.
  You must enter at least two unique tickers from the dataset and you
  can press the "+ Add Asset" button to add up to 20 assets. It is
  recommended to choose assets of the same class (i.e. stocks or
  cryptocurrencies) since it is hard to compare assets of different
  classes (you are encouraged, however, to see for yourself why this may
  be the case). Once you have chosen all your assets, you have the
  option to set the maximum allocation that can be given to any
  individual asset in the portfolio (the default is 100%). This number
  must be larger than 100% / (#assets - 1) and less than or equal to
  100%. Then you have the option to enter a custom benchmark. The
  default value is the the 3 month Treasury bill rate at the time of
  this site's development (November 2022: 3.72%) 
  but you can enter any value between -50% and 50% to use a custom
  rate, asset, or portfolio as your benchmark.

  If there are no errors in the input fields, a scatter plot should
  appear (below) giving a visual representation of the approximated
  maximum Sharpe ratio, single asset returns, efficient frontier,
  Markowitz bullet and tangency portfolio (as explained in the previous
  section). You can hover over or click on points on the plot to see the
  portfolios that produce each point on the efficient frontier (as well
  as for the max Sharpe ratio and the information for the single
  assets). Below that will be a pie chart visualizing the allocations
  that produced the maximum sharpe ratio and its corresponding
  information.

  visiting this site and reading the tutorial. I hope you enjoy it and
  learn something new!
